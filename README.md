# BillingSoftwareProject
This project is purely based on python The billing software is a program that calculates the total amount of a customer's purchase. 
It takes in the customer's name and phone number and generates a bill number, as well as the items they have purchased, along with their prices and quantities. 
The software calculates the subtotal, tax, and total, and displays the information to the user. The user can save and search their bills by using their bill numbers.
